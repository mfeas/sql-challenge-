# sql-challenge

Module Nine Challenge

For this challenge I started by downloading and viewing the CSV files provided. I then used the information available to
create an ERD using QuickDBD. Once I created my ERD I was able to use it as a guide to create my SQL tables. I used assistance
from youtube videos and ChatGPT to help me through attaching the CSV files to my SQL tables. Finally I created my SQL queries
to answer the provided questions for the challenge. Once I had the tables and CSV files connected I did have to refer back to
the slides from class to help build my queries. This was a simpler challenge than usual so my only resources were youtube,
chat gpt and the class slides.
